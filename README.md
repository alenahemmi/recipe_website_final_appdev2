Final project for CSC-303RZ-DA: Application Development 2

Django, JS, AJAX, CSS, all that good stuff to make a recipe storing social media 
where users can make a cook book, share recipes, comment on other people's recipes, stuff like that
very exciting!

I have no clue what I'm doing 
How am I a sophomore comp sci student that still struggles w git? (I'm so cooked)
